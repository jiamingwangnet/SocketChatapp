# SocketChatapp

A thing I made that uses a webserver written in C++ that function as a chat app.

## How to use

The executable is built using Visual Studio.

Make sure the `frontend` folder is in the same directory as the executable.

The messsages will be stored in `data/data.txt` as plain text.

The webserver will be started on the specified IP address and port.

## Message format

The message format is `[name]:[message]`.
